          <h2>Project Structure</h2>
          <p>
            The project is divided into two main parts: the <strong>Frontend</strong> and the <strong>Backend</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul className="structure-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Frontend:</strong> Built using React and TypeScript, the frontend handles the user interface, routing, and interaction with the backend API. It includes components for searching cocktails, viewing details, and navigating the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Backend:</strong> The backend is powered by the <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheCocktailDB API</a>, which provides a comprehensive database of cocktail recipes, ingredients, and images. The backend is responsible for serving cocktail data to the frontend.
            </li>

          <h2>Separation of Concerns</h2>
          <p>
            This project follows the principle of <strong>separation of concerns</strong> to ensure that each part of the application has a clear and distinct responsibility. Hereâ€™s how this was achieved:
          </p>
          <ul className="modular-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Components:</strong> The UI is broken down into reusable React components, such as the navigation bar, footer, and cocktail cards. This makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Services:</strong> API calls and data-fetching logic are handled in a dedicated service layer, keeping the components focused on rendering and user interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Routing:</strong> React Router is used to manage navigation between pages, ensuring a clean separation between different views (e.g., search, details, about).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Styling:</strong> CSS Modules are used to scope styles to individual components, preventing style conflicts and making the design system modular.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
